# Info-201-Final-Project

In this project, our group used the data from the Burke Gilman Trail north of NE 70th St Bicycle and Pedestrian Counter and Seattle-weather datasets to analyze the relationship between the commuter flow in Seattle and factors like season, weather, and holidays. 

By combining the season and weather with the average traffic, we can clearly see that in the spring, summer, and fall, the Burke Gilman Trail is much more popular among bikers than in the winter. This is also very consistent with our initial understanding. It is more convenient to travel when the weather is good, and people prefer to go out on sunny days. Excluding snow (since this only happens in the fall and winter), people travel by bike and foot the least when it rains. This is because visibility is very low on rainy days, and the wet ground makes it difficult to travel, which also increases the risk of falling or traffic accidents. Because Seattle has a lot of fog and drizzly weather in winter, people travel most on foggy and drizzling days, and about the same number of people travel on sunny days. According to this picture, we can see that people’s travel reaches the maximum on sunny days in summer, about 2500 on average. 

Because these datasets exclusively use statistics from the Burke Gilman Trail traffic counter on NE 70th St, our target audience primarily consists of Seattle's local residents and commuters, with a specific emphasis on students, staff, and faculty members affiliated with the University of Washington (UW) Seattle campus. This particular demographic is closely linked to the region's weather patterns, which notably shape the flow of bike and pedestrian traffic along this trail.

Our analysis of the trail and weather data reveals that seasonal variations exert a stronger influence compared to holiday dates, as holiday trends often align with seasonal patterns. Also, weather emerges as a key factor affecting biking behaviors, possibly due to commuters seeking alternative transportation options during adverse weather conditions, such as rain, snow, or low temperatures. When people encounter unfavorable weather, the likelihood that they venture outdoors decreases significantly

Our goal in analyzing this data is to provide insight into how seasonal and weather changes impact the commuter flow on Seattle’s trails. This information can be used as a means of increasing weather resilience among local commuters and as a way to argue for more effective weather-proofing measures on Seattle’s trails. This would entail having more consistently well-lit trails, increasing overhead coverage, and maintaining trail safety, cleanliness, and accessibility regardless of weather conditions.
